## aframe-react-boilerplate-test-work

Boilerplate for building virtual reality experiences with
[A-Frame](https://aframe.io) and React with
[aframe-react](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react).

### Installation

To get started:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

To publish to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run publish
```

**P.S.**
In real project `Redux` is in favor to be added. Because direct managing of components states is lead to a lot of couplings.
